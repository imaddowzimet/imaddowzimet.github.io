I'm a researcher and statistician interested in open science, computational reproducibility, and interesting ways to visualize data. In "**real life**" my main research focus is on sexual and reproductive health, and I may post occasionally about that in this space, but this site is mainly to host side analyses and projects that don't fit in to my main portfolio of work/aren't worth publishing in a scientific journal (or aren't developed enough to do that).

I'm in no way an R ninja (my main language is actually Stata), so feel free to let me know if you see errors in my code, or just ways that I could be doing things more easily. In general, feel free to leave comments on any post; love to hear any thoughts on how to improve my code/analyses/world.

(And this goes without saying, but any views posted here are my own.)
